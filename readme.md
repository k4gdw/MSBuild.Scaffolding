	MSBuildCommunity tasks)
*	`Enable-Versioning`  cmdlet  allows  to  easily  configure  solution  
	projects to use `SharedAssemblyInfo.cs`/`SharedAssemblyInfo.vb`.

Notes
-----
Please note that this package is the solution level package. It will  be
added to the solution itself.  It  won't  be  downloaded  by  the  NuGet
Package Restore feature. Hence all the needed files are being added into
Build folder. In order to use Enable-Versioning cmdlet package should be
installed.
